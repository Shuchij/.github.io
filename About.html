        <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Shuchi, a designer who tries to blend in learning with design.</h1>
          <p>With a work experience of 13+ years in Instructional Design and training, I consider User experience an extension of learning design.
            I believe analysis and research are essential for a impressive design outcome, be it in training or in product design.
            My approach is to go with simple designs and explore concepts that appeal to regular people. You do not always have to strive for a specific agenda
            or cause to make a difference. Sometimes small changes such as creating a intuitive navigation in a website with less number of clicks can make the
            lives of its users much better. At present, I am focussed on enhancing my skills in wireframing, branding and front-end development.</p>

        <h1>My Design Journey</h1>
            <p>Design was never very far from my world. I always enjoyed crafts more than art and needle work more than knitting.
              Professionally, I was introduced to design as a copy writer. Creative writing blended well with my hobbie of writing and my passion for
              travel. While I dedicated my intial writing career to travel writing and website content development, I always wanted to stay connected
              to the creative blend of writing. After recieving a job offer recommendation from a good friend I opted to make a career and a writing style
              change to technical writing. Unexpectedly, it was not technical writing that I got into. This writing was a blend of creative and technical writing
              styles, yet focussed more on the learning part. Instructional Design (ID) also known as learning design is a field of blended learning development,
              where technology and knowledge come together and user expectation always comes first. ID is a methedology that brings in instruction to the user
              through interactive content design. And this was the field that changed my perspective on design the most and moved me in the direction of
              human-interaction design.</p>
