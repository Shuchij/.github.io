                        <h3>Hi, Iâ€™m Shuchi, a designer who tries to blend in learning with design.</h3>
                              <p>With a work experience of 13+ years in Instructional Design and training, I consider User experience an extension of learning design. I believe
                                analysis and research are essential for a impressive design outcome, be it in training or in product design. My approach is to go with simple
                                designs and explore concepts that appeal to regular people. You do not always have to strive for a specific agenda or cause to make a difference.
                                Sometimes small changes such as creating a intuitive navigation in a website with less number of clicks can make the lives of its users much
                                better. At present, I am focussed on enhancing my skills in wireframing, branding and front-end development.</p>

                        <h3>My Design Journey</h3>
                              <p>Design was never very far from my world. I always enjoyed crafts more than art and needle work more than knitting. Professionally, I was introduced
                                 to design as a copy writer. Creative writing blended well with my hobbie of writing and my passion for travel. While I dedicated my intial writing
                                 career to travel writing and website content development, I always wanted to stay connected to the creative blend of writing. After recieving a job
                                 offer recommendation from a good friend I opted to make a career and a writing style change to technical writing. Unexpectedly, it was not technical
                                 writing that I got into. This writing was a blend of creative and technical writing styles, yet focussed more on the learning part. Instructional
                                 Design (ID) also known as learning design is a field of blended learning development, where technology and knowledge come together and user
                                 expectation always comes first. ID is a methedology that brings in instruction to the user through interactive content design. And this was the
                                 field that changed my perspective on design the most and moved me in the direction of human-interaction design.</p>

                        <h3>On the personal front...</h3>
                              <p>I am based in Washington DC, where I work and live with my loving husband. I am an ardent reader, who loves to cook and experiment with new
                                 recipes and travelling to new places.</p>

                        <h3>Drop in a line</h3>
                              <p>I'm always interested to hear of new projects and collaborations, so feel free to <u>get in touch</u>. Work project samples will be made
                                 available upon request.</p>
